                    Hello my name is Marco Serrano and to me,
                    coding is like one giant puzzle except there isnâ€™t just one solution.
                    Two different people will almost always have a vastly different answer
                    which is what intrigues me the most. I am a 22 year old Software Engineer
                    from Portland, Oregon excited to contribute to vast community of developers.
                    In my spare time I like to spend time playing and watching basketball. I also
                    really enjoy learning new technologies and overall just expanding my knowledge.
                    Thank you for taking the time to scroll through my portfolio and my past projects
                    which I enjoyed putting together.
                </p>
