                        Hello my name is Marco Serrano and to me,
                        coding is like one giant puzzle except there isnâ€™t just one solution.
                        Two different people will almost always have a vastly different answer
                        which is what intrigues me the most. I am a 22 year old Software Engineer
                        from Portland, Oregon excited to contribute to a vast community of developers.
                        In my spare time I like to spend time playing and watching a lot of basketball. I also
                        really enjoy learning new technologies and overall just expanding my knowledge in my
                        field, which is a big reason why I chose Software Engineering as a career.
                        Thank you for taking the time to find my portfolio, please look
                        through my resume and projects while you're here!
